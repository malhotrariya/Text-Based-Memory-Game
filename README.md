# Text Based Memory Game
Memory is a classic matching game played with a deck of paired cards. At the beginning of the game, all cards are placed face-down on the table. With each turn, the player has the opportunity to flip over two face-down cards. If the cards match, they remain face-up, revealing their contents. However, if the cards do not match, the player must flip them face-down again, obscuring their identities. The objective of the game is to successfully match all the cards, flipping them face-up, while aiming to accomplish this task in as few turns as possible. 

**This assignment contains code for implementing a text-based game of Memory. Each problem corresponds to a specific aspect of the game's functionality**

## Lists and Randomization
To create the initial board of cards based on a list of words, incorporating concepts of lists and random shuffling

## Lists and String Formatting
- Displaying the current state of the board, showcasing the utilization of lists and string formatting for user interaction
- Identifying and returning a list of indexes for face-up cards on the board, focusing on list manipulation

## User Input Handling
Allow the user to pick an index for a card to flip, emphasizing user input handling, validation, and error management

## File Handling
Loading a list of words from a file, illustrating file-handling concepts to enhance the variety of words used in the game

## Integration and Game Logic
Implement the main game loop, integrating the previously developed functions to set up the board, manage user interactions, and determine matches
